<center><p style="color:black;font-size:28px;"> This is our 1.1.9 project, called Pizza Maker. In this project, the user will be presented with a pizza dough and a cursor at the center of the screen.
		  The user can click and drag on the cursor, then click a key on their keyboard that is binded to a certain pizza topping, and that topping will be
		  created on the pizza. Keybinds include "p" for pepperoni, "o" for olive, "a" for pineapple, "n" for onion, and "g" for green peppers.</p></center>

<center><p style="color:black;font-size:28px;"> This is our 1.2.5 project, based off of the game Frogger. The program will ask for your name and the color you would like your character
		to be, then you will start on one end of the lake. The goal is to get across the river using the arrow keys, without being hit by the turtles racing across. If you are 
		hit, your character will restart.</p></center>

<center><p style="color:black;font-size:28px;"> This is our 1.3.1 project, an original interactive story game. In this game, you are a lonely monster who is feared by the townspeople,
	but you would do anything to be friends with them. The Console asks the player a series of questions, each one with 2 choices, a good answer and an evil answer. If the good
	answer is chosen, you will continue until you become friends with the people. If you choose the evil answer, you become sad and game over.p></center>
